# Many-World Graph Book

Gaining profound insights from collected data of todayâ€™s application domains like IoT, cyber-physical systems, health care, or the financial sector is business-critical. However, analyzing these data and turning it into valuable insights is a huge challenge. This is often not alone due to the large volume of data but due to an incredibly high domain complexity, which makes it necessary to combine various extrapolation and prediction methods to understand the collected data. 

To tackle this issue, Many World Graph (mwg) propose an innovative data structure that can ingest timed data and propose seamlessly prediction and hypothetical anlytics on it. To do so, mwg propose to consider Graph nodes as time-series like structure and offers and efficient fork-like operator to express many variation on a Big Data Graph.

Machine Learning and batteries are included. MWG can handle hundred of thousand of values per second on a single computer. Finally, MWG is a framework, data are specialized by a domain experts through various graph traversal operation and machine learning configuration... make it yours !
